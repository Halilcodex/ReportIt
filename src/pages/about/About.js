          <span>Project ReportIt</span> is a web app advocating against sexual
          violence, providing access to organizations that would assist victims
          and supporting survivors with psychosocial services. We advocate for
          rape survivors who canâ€™t speak about their ordeal openly from fear of
          stigmatization, by giving then opportunity to report the perpetrators
          discreetly and if possibly anonymously. We use this platform to
          educate people and also engage in interactive sessions via this app.
          We are working towards the day when rape is part of history, rather
          than a part of our everyday lives.
